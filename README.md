# üß† Track Quiz - A Python Quiz Game with Tkinter

Track Quiz is a comprehensive quiz game developed in Python, featuring a graphical user interface built entirely with the Tkinter library. This project was designed to practice several key application development concepts: creating user interfaces, managing external data, and data persistence.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Intuitive GUI:** A clean and responsive user interface built with **Tkinter**, organized into multiple "pages" (Menu, Game, Scoreboard).
*   **External Data Loading:** The quiz dynamically loads all questions from a `questions.csv` file, separating data from the source code.
*   **Multi-type Question Support:** Handles both purely textual questions and **image-based** questions (thanks to the Pillow library).
*   **Theme System:** Questions can be filtered by theme via a dropdown menu, allowing for specialized quizzes.
*   **Score Persistence:** High scores are automatically saved to a `scoreboard.json` file. The leaderboard is maintained and sorted for each theme individually.
*   **Flexible Answer Validation:** The verification system accepts multiple variations of the correct answer (e.g., "Victor Hugo|hugo") and is not case- or space-sensitive.
